**Changed**:
```javascript
const roleDashboardMap = {
  admin: "/admin/dashboard",

  { name: "Analytics", path: "/shop/analytics", icon: BarChart3 },
  { name: "Sponsorships", path: "/shop/sponsorships", icon: Handshake },
];

// AFTER:
const mainLinks = [
  { name: "Orders", path: "/shop/orders", icon: ShoppingCart },  // ✅ Now first
  { name: "Catalog", path: "/shop/catalog", icon: Package },
  { name: "Analytics", path: "/shop/analytics", icon: BarChart3 },
  { name: "Sponsorships", path: "/shop/sponsorships", icon: Handshake },
];
```

**Removed Home Icon Import**:
```javascript
// REMOVED:
import { Home } from "lucide-react";  // Was only used for Dashboard
```

## Login Flow After Changes

### Before:
1. Shop owner logs in
2. Redirected to: `http://localhost:5173/shop/dashboard` ❌
3. Result: 404 Error (page doesn't exist)

### After:
1. Shop owner logs in
2. Redirected to: `http://localhost:5173/shop/orders` ✅
3. Result: Orders page loads successfully

## All Updated Components

| Component | File | Change |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Login | `client/src/components/auth/login.jsx` | Updated redirect map |
| Sidebar | `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` | Removed Dashboard link |
| Navbar | `client/src/components/Navbar.jsx` | Removed Dashboard link (already done) |
| App Router | `client/src/App.jsx` | Removed Dashboard route (already done) |

## Testing

### Test Login Redirect
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Navigate to login page: `http://localhost:5173/`
3. Login with shop credentials:
   - Email: `art2@gmail.com` (or any shop email)
   - Password: (shop password)
4. **Expected Result**: Redirected to `http://localhost:5173/shop/orders`
5. **Verify**: Orders page loads without errors

### Test Navigation
After login, verify all navigation links work:
- ✅ Orders → `/shop/orders`
- ✅ Catalog → `/shop/catalog`
- ✅ Analytics → `/shop/analytics`
- ✅ Sponsorships → `/shop/sponsorships`
- ✅ Profile (from dropdown) → `/shop/profile`

### Test Sidebar (if used)
If Sidebar component is used anywhere:
- ✅ Verify Dashboard link is removed
- ✅ Verify all 4 remaining links work
- ✅ No 404 errors when clicking links

## Why Orders Page?

**Orders** was chosen as the default landing page because:
1. ✅ Most frequently accessed by shop owners
2. ✅ Critical for business operations (managing customer orders)
3. ✅ Provides immediate actionable information
4. ✅ Better user experience than landing on empty catalog

### Alternative Options
If you prefer a different landing page, you can change it to:

**Catalog** (for product management):
```javascript
shop: "/shop/orders",  // Change this
```

**Profile** (for account setup):
```javascript
shop: "/shop/profile",
```
