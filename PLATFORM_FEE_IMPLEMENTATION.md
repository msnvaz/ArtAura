# Platform Fee Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic platform fee calculation and insertion when delivery partners mark orders as delivered.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **payment table**: Stores payment records for both artwork orders and commission requests
- **platform_fees table**: Stores calculated platform fees linked to payment records

### 2. Backend Changes

#### DeliveryRequestDAOImpl.java
- Modified `getActiveArtworkOrderDeliveryRequests()` to include `payment_amount` from payment table
- Modified `getActiveCommissionDeliveryRequests()` to include `payment_amount` from payment table
- Added `insertPlatformFee()` method to:
  - Insert calculated platform fees into `platform_fees` table
  - Update payment status to 'paid' in `AW_orders.status` or `commission_requests.payment_status`

#### DeliveryRequestService.java
- Added `insertPlatformFee()` method to handle platform fee insertion

#### DeliveryStatusController.java
- Modified `markAsDelivered()` endpoint to:
  - Fetch platform fee percentage from admin_settings
  - Fetch payment amount from payment table
  - Calculate platform commission fee: `platformCommissionFee = (paymentAmount × platformFee) / 100`
  - Insert calculated fee into platform_fees table
  - Return payment amount in response

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### ActiveDeliveries.jsx
- Modified data transformation to include `paymentAmount` from backend response
- Updated alert message to display payment amount from delivery object
- Shows payment amount and platform fee when marking as delivered

## Calculation Formula
```
platformCommissionFee = (paymentAmount × platformFee) / 100
```

Example:
- Payment Amount: Rs 2,000
- Platform Fee: 5%
- Platform Commission Fee: Rs 100.00

## Database Relationships
```
payment (id) ← platform_fees (payment_id)
payment (AW_order_id) → AW_orders (id)
payment (commission_request_id) → commission_requests (id)
```

## Payment Status Updates
When marking a delivery as "delivered":
1. Platform fee is calculated and inserted into `platform_fees` table
2. For **Artwork Orders**: `AW_orders.status` is updated to `'paid'`
3. For **Commission Requests**: `commission_requests.payment_status` is updated to `'paid'`

This ensures that once the delivery is completed and platform fee is collected, the order payment status is properly marked as paid.

## Important Notes
1. Payment records must exist in the `payment` table for platform fees to be calculated
2. If no payment record exists, the system logs a warning but continues with delivery status update
3. Platform fee is stored with 2 decimal places precision
4. The platform fee is automatically inserted when marking delivery as "delivered"

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Ensure payment record exists for the order in `payment` table
2. Mark delivery as delivered from Active Deliveries page
3. Check console logs for calculation details
4. Verify `platform_fees` table has new record with correct `fee_amount`
5. Verify payment status updated to 'paid':
   - For artwork orders: Check `AW_orders.status = 'paid'`
   - For commission requests: Check `commission_requests.payment_status = 'paid'`
6. Alert message should display the payment amount

## Complete Flow When Marking as Delivered
1. ✅ Delivery partner clicks "Mark as Delivered" button
2. ✅ Backend fetches platform fee percentage from `admin_settings` (e.g., "5")
3. ✅ Backend fetches payment amount from `payment` table
4. ✅ Backend calculates: `platformCommissionFee = (paymentAmount × platformFee) / 100`
5. ✅ Backend gets `payment_id` from payment table
6. ✅ Backend inserts fee into `platform_fees` table
7. ✅ Backend updates payment status:
   - If artwork order: `UPDATE AW_orders SET status = 'paid' WHERE id = ?`
   - If commission: `UPDATE commission_requests SET payment_status = 'paid' WHERE id = ?`
8. ✅ Backend updates delivery status to 'delivered'
9. ✅ Frontend displays alert with payment amount and platform fee
10. ✅ Delivery is removed from active deliveries list

## Error Handling
- Returns null if no payment found (won't crash the application)
- Logs detailed error messages for debugging
- Converts platform fee string to float safely
- Handles division with proper rounding (HALF_UP, 2 decimal places)
