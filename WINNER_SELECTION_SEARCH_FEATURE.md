# Winner Selection - Search Feature Guide

## Overview
Added a real-time search functionality to filter completed challenges in the Winner Selection page. Users can now type to search by challenge name, description, or category.

## New Features

### 1. **Search Input Field**
- **Location**: Above the challenge dropdown in "View Winners and Criteria Details" section
- **Functionality**: Real-time filtering as you type
- **Search Fields**: 
  - Challenge name/title
  - Description
  - Category
- **Case-insensitive**: Works with any letter case

### 2. **Visual Features**
- 🔍 Search icon on the left side of input
- ✕ Clear button (appears when text is entered)
- Placeholder text: "Search completed challenges by name, description, or category..."
- Styled to match the existing design theme

### 3. **Dynamic Filtering**
- Dropdown updates in real-time as you type
- Shows filtered count: "Showing X of Y completed challenges"
- Empty state message when no matches found
- Maintains challenge selection guard (only completed challenges)

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Navigate** to Winner Selection page (Moderator Dashboard → Winners tab)
2. **Type** in the search box to filter challenges
3. **Select** a challenge from the filtered dropdown
4. **View** the challenge details, scoring criteria, and winners

### Search Behavior:
```
Input: "abstract"
Results: Shows all challenges with "abstract" in name, description, or category

Input: "photo"
Results: Shows "Landscape Photography Challenge", etc.

Input: "2024"
Results: Shows challenges with 2024 in their name or description
```

### Clear Search:
- Click the ✕ button in the search field
- Or delete all text manually
- Dropdown resets to show all completed challenges

## Code Implementation

### New State Variable:
```javascript
const [challengeSearchTerm, setChallengeSearchTerm] = useState('');
```

### Filtering Logic:
```javascript
const filteredPastChallenges = pastChallenges.filter(challenge => {
  if (!challengeSearchTerm) return true; // Show all if no search term
  const searchLower = challengeSearchTerm.toLowerCase();
  return (
    challenge.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    challenge.description?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    challenge.category?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
  );
});
```

### Search Input Component:
```jsx
<div className="relative mb-4">
  <Search className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2" size={20} />
  <input
    type="text"
    placeholder="Search completed challenges..."
    value={challengeSearchTerm}
    onChange={(e) => setChallengeSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
    className="w-full pl-10 pr-4 py-3 border rounded-lg..."
  />
  {challengeSearchTerm && (
    <button onClick={() => setChallengeSearchTerm('')}>✕</button>
  )}
</div>
```

## UI/UX Features

### Search Input Styling:
- **Border Color**: `#D87C5A` (matches theme)
- **Background**: White
- **Padding**: Accommodates search icon on left
- **Focus State**: Ring effect on focus
- **Clear Button**: Appears only when text is present

### Results Count:
- Displays below dropdown when search is active
- Format: "Showing X of Y completed challenges"
- Color: `#7f5539` (brown tone)

### Empty State:
- Dropdown shows: "No challenges found for 'search term'"
- Helps users understand why dropdown is empty

## Examples

### Example 1: Search by Name
```
User types: "art"
Shows:
- Abstract Art Contest

```

### Example 2: Search by Category

### Example 3: Search by Date
```

Shows:
- All challenges completed in 2025
- Challenges with 2025 in name/description
```

### Example 4: No Results
```
User types: "xyz123"
Dropdown shows: "No challenges found for 'xyz123'"
Count shows: "Showing 0 of 6 completed challenges"
```
