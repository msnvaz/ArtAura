```sql

-- Optional: Add foreign key constraint if artists table exists
-- Check your database first with: SHOW TABLES; and DESCRIBE artists;
-- If artists table exists with artist_id column, uncomment and run:
-- ALTER TABLE artist_exhibitions 
-- ADD CONSTRAINT fk_artist_exhibitions_artist_id 
-- FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(artist_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Insert sample exhibition data for testing

### Sample Data
The sample data includes various exhibition types and statuses to test the functionality across different scenarios.

## Backend Implementation

### Complete CRUD API Endpoints
- `POST /api/exhibitions/create` - Create new exhibition
- `GET /api/exhibitions/artist/{artistId}` - Get all exhibitions for an artist

- `PUT /api/exhibitions/{exhibitionId}` - Update exhibition
- `DELETE /api/exhibitions/{exhibitionId}` - Delete exhibition
- `GET /api/exhibitions/status/{status}` - Get exhibitions by status
- `GET /api/exhibitions/featured` - Get featured exhibitions
- `GET /api/exhibitions/statistics/artist/{artistId}` - Get exhibition statistics

### Security
- JWT Authentication required for create, update, delete operations
- CORS configured for frontend access
- Input validation at service layer
- SQL injection protection through JdbcTemplate

## Frontend Implementation

### React Component Features
- Complete CRUD interface with modals
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time data updates
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Integration

### Portfolio Integration

- Seamless integration with existing authentication
- Consistent styling with portfolio theme

### Button Text Change
- Changed from "Apply for Exhibition" to "Add Exhibition Details" as requested
- Updated to reflect CRUD functionality rather than application process

## Testing

1. Run the SQL commands to create the table and sample data
2. Start the backend server
3. Start the frontend development server
4. Navigate to Artist Portfolio â†’ Exhibitions tab
5. Test all CRUD operations:
   - Create new exhibitions
   - Edit existing exhibitions
   - Delete exhibitions
   - View exhibition lists with proper formatting

The system is now ready for full exhibition management with both backend API and frontend interface complete.
