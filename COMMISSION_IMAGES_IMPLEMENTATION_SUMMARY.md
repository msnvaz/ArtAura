## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: React Hooks Error ✅
**Error:** `Rendered more hooks than during the previous render`

**Cause:** 
- `useEffect` called after conditional return
- Missing React import for useEffect

**Fix:**
- Imported `useEffect` from 'react'
- Moved all hooks before conditional returns
- Proper hook ordering maintained

### Issue 2: Missing Image Files ✅
**Error:** `Failed to load image: /uploads/[filename].webp`

**Cause:**
- Database has image paths
- Physical files don't exist on server

**Fix:**
- Show "Image Missing" placeholder for thumbnails
- Show professional error message in modal
- Provide file path in error display
- Created SQL scripts to clean database
- Only log warnings in development mode

### Issue 3: Console Log Spam ✅
**Error:** Too many console logs in production

**Fix:**
- Wrapped all console logs with `if (import.meta.env.DEV)`
- Changed errors to warnings (⚠️ instead of ❌)
- Reduced verbosity of logs
- Clean console in production mode

## 💻 Console Output

### Development Mode:
```
📦 Commission Requests loaded: 6
📸 Requests with images: ele: 3 images, Moratuwa: 1 image, Starry Nights: 1 image
⚠️ Commission image not found: /uploads/1760987696277_...webp
✅ Image loaded: /uploads/1760615699222_bg1.jpg
```

### Production Mode:
```
(Silent - no console logs unless critical errors)
```

---

## 📊 Database Status

### Your Current Data:
```sql
Commission #10 (ele):           3 images
Commission #11 (Moratuwa):      1 image  
Commission #12:                 1 image
Commission #14:                 1 image
Commission #29 (Starry Nights): 1 image (file missing)
```

### To Fix Missing Files:
```sql
-- Option 1: Delete broken record
DELETE FROM commission_reference_images 
WHERE image_url LIKE '%1760987696277%';

-- Option 2: Replace with test image
UPDATE commission_reference_images 
SET image_url = '/art2.jpeg' 
WHERE image_url LIKE '%1760987696277%';
```
