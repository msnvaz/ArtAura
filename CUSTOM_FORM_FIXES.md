# Custom Artwork Request Form - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Scrolling Problems
**Problem**: Modal content was constrained by `max-h-[95vh]` and content was being cut off.

**Solution**: 
- Changed modal structure to use `items-start` instead of `items-center` for better vertical positioning
- Added proper scrollable container with `max-h-[calc(100vh-200px)]` for the form content
- Made header sticky with `sticky top-0` so it remains visible while scrolling
- Added proper margins with `my-8` for better spacing

### 2. Form Update Issues
**Problem**: Form inputs might have had event handling or state update issues.

**Solution**:
- Improved file input handling with proper click events
- Added unique ID to file input for better accessibility
- Enhanced file upload area with proper click handlers
- Fixed drag and drop functionality

### 3. Responsive Design Issues
**Problem**: Layout was breaking on smaller screens.

**Solution**:
- Changed grid from `lg:grid-cols-2` to `xl:grid-cols-2` for better breakpoint handling
- Updated all 2-column grids to be responsive with `sm:grid-cols-2`
- Improved size selection grid to be `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Added proper order classes for consistent layout

### 4. User Experience Improvements
**Solution**:
- Made file upload area clickable for better UX
- Added border to image previews for better visual separation
- Enhanced hover effects on remove buttons
- Improved button styling and feedback
