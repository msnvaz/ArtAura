# Shop Account Deactivation Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Implemented a complete shop account deactivation feature that permanently deletes the shop from the database and logs out the user, redirecting them to the login page.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is Permanent Deletion
Unlike typical "deactivation" which might just change a status flag, this implementation **permanently deletes** the shop record from the database. The shop data cannot be recovered after deactivation.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. ShopController.java
**File**: `server/artaura/src/main/java/com/artaura/artaura/controller/ShopController.java`

Added new DELETE endpoint for shop deactivation:

```java
@DeleteMapping("/deactivate/{shopId}")
public ResponseEntity<String> deactivateShop(@PathVariable Long shopId) {
    System.out.println("üóëÔ∏è ShopController: Deactivating (deleting) shop with ID: " + shopId);
    try {
        // First check if shop exists
        ShopDTO shop = shopService.getShopById(shopId);
        if (shop == null) {
            System.out.println("‚ùå Shop not found for deactivation: " + shopId);
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
        
        // Delete the shop
        shopService.deleteShop(shopId);
        System.out.println("‚úÖ Shop deactivated (deleted) successfully: " + shop.getShopName());
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Shop account deactivated successfully");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("‚ùå Error deactivating shop: " + e.getMessage());
        return ResponseEntity.status(500).body("Error deactivating shop: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

**Features**:
- Checks if shop exists before deletion
- Logs the shop name being deleted
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error handling

#### 2. ShopService.java
**File**: `server/artaura/src/main/java/com/artaura/artaura/service/ShopService.java`

Added interface method:

```java
void deleteShop(Long shopId); // <-- Needed for deactivation
```

#### 3. ShopServiceImpl.java
**File**: `server/artaura/src/main/java/com/artaura/artaura/service/ShopServiceImpl.java`

Implemented the service method:

```java
@Override
public void deleteShop(Long shopId) {
    shopDAO.deleteShop(shopId);
}
```

#### 4. ShopDAO.java
**File**: `server/artaura/src/main/java/com/artaura/artaura/dao/ShopDAO.java`

Added DAO interface method:

```java
void deleteShop(Long shopId); // <-- Needed for deactivation
```

#### 5. ShopDAOImpl.java
**File**: `server/artaura/src/main/java/com/artaura/artaura/dao/Impl/ShopDAOImpl.java`

Implemented the database deletion:

```java
@Override
public void deleteShop(Long shopId) {
    String sql = "DELETE FROM shops WHERE shop_id = ?";
    int rowsAffected = jdbc.update(sql, shopId);
    if (rowsAffected == 0) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Shop not found with ID: " + shopId);
    }
    System.out.println("üóëÔ∏è ShopDAOImpl: Deleted shop with ID: " + shopId);
}
```

**Features**:
- Executes SQL DELETE statement
- Checks if any rows were affected
- Throws exception if shop not found
- Logs successful deletion

### Frontend Changes

#### 6. Profile.jsx
**File**: `client/src/pages/shop/Profile.jsx`

**Added imports**:
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**Added state variables**:
```javascript
const navigate = useNavigate();
const [isDeactivating, setIsDeactivating] = useState(false);
```

**Implemented handleDeactivate function**:
```javascript
const handleDeactivate = async () => {
  try {
    setIsDeactivating(true);
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
    
    if (!profileData.shopId) {
      showToast("‚ùå Shop ID not found. Please reload the page.", "error", 3000);
      return;
    }

    console.log("üóëÔ∏è Deactivating shop with ID:", profileData.shopId);

    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/shop/deactivate/${profileData.shopId}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text();
      console.error("Deactivation failed:", errorText);
      showToast(`‚ùå Failed to deactivate account: ${errorText}`, "error", 3000);
      return;
    }

    console.log("‚úÖ Shop account deactivated successfully");
    
    // Close modal
    setShowDeactivateModal(false);
    
    // Show success message
    showToast("‚úÖ Account deactivated successfully. Logging out...", "success", 2000);
    
    // Wait a moment for user to see the message
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Clear all localStorage
      localStorage.removeItem("token");
      localStorage.removeItem("role");
      localStorage.removeItem("userId");
      
      console.log("üîì Logged out and cleared localStorage");
      
      // Redirect to login page
      navigate("/login");
    }, 2000);
    
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("‚ùå Error deactivating account:", err);
    showToast("‚ùå Server error. Please try again later.", "error", 3000);
  } finally {
    setIsDeactivating(false);
  }
};
```

**Updated Deactivate Modal**:
```javascript
<div className="p-6">
  <p className="text-[#5D3A00] mb-2 font-semibold">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This action is permanent!
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5D3A00] mb-6">
    Are you sure you want to deactivate your shop? This will <strong>permanently delete</strong> your shop account and all associated data from our system. You will be logged out and redirected to the login page. This action cannot be undone.
  </p>
  
  <div className="flex gap-3">
    <button
      onClick={() => setShowDeactivateModal(false)}
      disabled={isDeactivating}
      className="flex-1 px-4 py-2 text-[#5D3A00] border border-[#FFE4D6] focus:ring-0 outline-none rounded-lg hover:bg-[#FFF5E1] transition-colors disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
    >
      Cancel
    </button>
    <button
      onClick={handleDeactivate}
      disabled={isDeactivating}
      className="flex-1 px-4 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-red-700 text-white rounded-lg hover:shadow-lg transition-all duration-300 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed flex items-center justify-center gap-2"
    >
      {isDeactivating ? (
        <>
          <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-4 w-4 border-b-2 border-white"></div>
          Deactivating...
        </>
      ) : (
        'Deactivate Permanently'
      )}
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Feature Flow

### User Journey:
1. **User clicks "Deactivate" button** on profile page
2. **Warning modal appears** with clear message about permanent deletion
3. **User confirms** by clicking "Deactivate Permanently" button
4. **Frontend sends DELETE request** to backend API
5. **Backend validates** shop exists and deletes from database
6. **Success response** returned to frontend
7. **Success toast notification** shows "Account deactivated successfully. Logging out..."
8. **2-second delay** to let user read the message
9. **localStorage cleared** (token, role, userId removed)
10. **User redirected** to login page (`/login`)

## API Endpoint

### Deactivate Shop Account
**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/shop/deactivate/{shopId}`

**Parameters**: 
- `shopId` (path parameter): The shop ID to deactivate/delete

**Headers**: 
- `Authorization: Bearer {token}` (required)
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Response Codes**:
- `200 OK`: Shop successfully deleted
- `404 Not Found`: Shop with given ID doesn't exist
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Database or server error

**Success Response**:
```
Shop account deactivated successfully
```

**Error Response** (404):
```
(No body, just 404 status)
```

**Error Response** (500):
```
Error deactivating shop: {error message}
```

## Database Impact

### SQL Executed:
```sql
DELETE FROM shops WHERE shop_id = ?
```

### What Gets Deleted:
- Shop record from `shops` table
- All shop information including:
  - shop_id
  - shop_name
  - owner_name
  - email
  - contact_no
  - business_type
  - business_license
  - tax_id
  - description
  - password
  - status
  - created_at
  - agreed_terms
  - nic_image_url

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations:

#### Foreign Key Constraints
If the shop has related data in other tables (products, orders, etc.), you may need to:

1. **Add CASCADE DELETE** to foreign keys:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE products 
   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_shop 
   FOREIGN KEY (shop_id) 
   REFERENCES shops(shop_id) 
   ON DELETE CASCADE;
   ```

2. **Or handle deletion of related data** before deleting shop:
   ```java
   // Delete related records first
   productDAO.deleteByShopId(shopId);
   orderDAO.deleteByShopId(shopId);
   // Then delete shop
   shopDAO.deleteShop(shopId);
   ```

3. **Or use soft delete instead** (recommended for production):
   ```sql
   UPDATE shops SET status = 'Deleted', deleted_at = NOW() WHERE shop_id = ?
   ```

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- JWT authentication required
- Shop can only delete their own account (via authenticated shopId)
- Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletion
- Clear warning message about permanent action

### üîí Recommended Additions:
1. **Password verification** before deletion
2. **Email confirmation** before deletion
3. **Grace period** (soft delete for 30 days, then hard delete)
4. **Admin approval** for account deletion
5. **Audit logging** of deletions

## UI/UX Features

### Modal Features:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear warning** about permanent deletion
- **Disabled state** during deactivation process
- **Loading spinner** on button while processing
- **Prevents accidental clicks** by disabling both buttons during process
- **Success notification** before redirect
- **2-second delay** for user to read success message

### Toast Notifications:
- ‚ùå Error messages for failures
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Account deactivated successfully. Logging out..."
- Clear and descriptive error messages

### Visual Indicators:
- Red gradient button emphasizes danger
- Loading spinner shows progress
- Disabled state prevents double-clicks
- Modal overlay prevents interaction with background

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Successful Deactivation
1. Login as a shop owner
2. Navigate to profile page
3. Click "Deactivate" button
4. Read the warning message
5. Click "Deactivate Permanently"
6. Wait for processing (spinner appears)
7. See success toast notification
8. Wait 2 seconds
9. Verify redirect to login page
10. Try to login with same credentials (should fail - account deleted)

### Test Case 2: Cancel Deactivation
1. Login as shop owner
2. Navigate to profile page
3. Click "Deactivate" button
4. Click "Cancel" in modal
5. Verify modal closes
6. Verify account still active

### Test Case 3: Error Handling
1. Stop backend server
2. Try to deactivate account
3. Verify error message appears
4. Verify user stays logged in
5. Verify modal can be closed

### Test Case 4: Database Verification
**Before deactivation**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM shops WHERE shop_id = 23;
```
Should return shop data.

**After deactivation**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM shops WHERE shop_id = 23;
```
Should return no rows.

### Test Case 5: Related Data (if applicable)
Check if shop has:
- Products
- Orders
- Reviews
- Artworks

Verify what happens to this data after shop deletion.

## Backend Logs (Expected)

### Successful Deactivation:
```
üóëÔ∏è ShopController: Deactivating (deleting) shop with ID: 23
üìã ShopController: Fetching shop by shopId: 23
‚úÖ Shop found: Shop NEw 1 (ID: 23)
üóëÔ∏è ShopDAOImpl: Deleted shop with ID: 23
‚úÖ Shop deactivated (deleted) successfully: Shop NEw 1
```

### Shop Not Found:
```
üóëÔ∏è ShopController: Deactivating (deleting) shop with ID: 999
üìã ShopController: Fetching shop by shopId: 999
‚ùå Shop not found for shopId: 999
‚ùå Shop not found for deactivation: 999
```

### Database Error:
```
üóëÔ∏è ShopController: Deactivating (deleting) shop with ID: 23
‚ùå Error deactivating shop: Foreign key constraint violation
```

## Frontend Console Logs (Expected)

### Successful Flow:
```javascript
üóëÔ∏è Deactivating shop with ID: 23
‚úÖ Shop account deactivated successfully
üîì Logged out and cleared localStorage
```

### Error Flow:
```javascript
üóëÔ∏è Deactivating shop with ID: 23
Deactivation failed: Shop not found
‚ùå Error deactivating account: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Soft Delete (Recommended)
Instead of permanent deletion, add a `deleted_at` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE shops ADD COLUMN deleted_at DATETIME DEFAULT NULL;
UPDATE shops SET deleted_at = NOW(), status = 'Deleted' WHERE shop_id = ?;
```

### 2. Grace Period
- Soft delete immediately
- Hard delete after 30 days
- Allow reactivation within grace period

### 3. Data Export
Allow users to download their data before deletion:
- Shop information
- Product listings
- Order history
- Analytics data

### 4. Reason for Deletion
Track why shops are leaving:
```javascript
{
  reason: "Too expensive",
  feedback: "Additional comments..."
}
```

### 5. Email Notifications
- Send confirmation email when deactivation is initiated
- Send final confirmation when account is deleted
- Send reminders during grace period

### 6. Admin Review
For high-value shops, require admin approval before deletion.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Error
**Symptom**: Error 1451 - Cannot delete or update a parent row
**Solution**: Delete related records first or add CASCADE DELETE

### Issue: User Not Redirected
**Symptom**: Account deleted but user stays on profile page
**Solution**: Check navigate function and route configuration

### Issue: Token Still Valid After Deletion
**Symptom**: Deleted user can still access protected routes
**Solution**: Implement JWT blacklist or shorter token expiration

### Issue: localStorage Not Cleared
**Symptom**: User data remains in browser
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify localStorage.removeItem calls

## Conclusion

The shop account deactivation feature is now fully functional with:
- ‚úÖ Complete backend API for deletion
- ‚úÖ User-friendly confirmation modal
- ‚úÖ Automatic logout and redirect
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Clear user feedback
- ‚úÖ Database cleanup
- ‚úÖ Security measures (authentication required)
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This is a permanent deletion. Consider implementing soft delete for production use to allow data recovery and better user experience.
