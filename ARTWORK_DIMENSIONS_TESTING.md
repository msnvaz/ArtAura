# Testing Artwork Dimensions from Database

## Test Query to Verify Data
Run this SQL query to see what dimensions are available:

```sql
SELECT 
    ao.id AS order_id,
    aoi.title AS artwork_title,
    aw.size AS artwork_size,
    aw.medium AS artwork_medium,
    ao.delivery_status
FROM AW_orders ao
LEFT JOIN AW_order_items aoi ON ao.id = aoi.order_id
LEFT JOIN artworks aw ON aoi.artwork_id = aw.artwork_id
WHERE ao.delivery_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY ao.order_date DESC;
```

## Expected Results Based on Sample Data

For orders with artwork_ids:
- **artwork_id 3** (Abstract Flow): size = '18" x 24"'
- **artwork_id 14** (Birds 2): size = 'A4'
- **artwork_id 19** (Wakanda Forever): size = '30\'*30'
- **artwork_id 22** (Woman in dark): size = 'A4'

## Backend Changes Made

### 1. DeliveryStatusDAOImpl.java - getPendingArtworkOrders()
Added these fields to the SELECT:
```java
aw.size AS artwork_dimensions,
aw.medium AS artwork_type
```

And added JOIN:
```java
LEFT JOIN artworks aw ON aoi.artwork_id = aw.artwork_id
```

### 2. DeliveryRequestDAOImpl.java - Multiple Methods
Already updated in previous commit to include artwork size.

## Frontend Handling

The frontend code at line 105 already handles the field correctly:
```javascript
size: order.artwork_dimensions || order.dimensions || 'N/A'
```

This will:
1. First try `order.artwork_dimensions` (from artworks table)
2. Fall back to `order.dimensions` (if available)
3. Show 'N/A' if neither is available

## Troubleshooting

If dimensions still don't show:

1. **Check Backend Response**: Add console.log in frontend to see what's being returned:
```javascript
console.log('Artwork order data:', order);
```

2. **Verify Database**: Run the test query above

3. **Check Network Tab**: Look at the API response in browser DevTools

4. **Verify API Endpoint**: Make sure the frontend is calling the correct endpoint (should use `/delivery-status/pending`)

## Note About Empty Size Fields
Some artworks in the database have empty `size` fields (e.g., artwork_id 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13). 
For these, the frontend will display 'N/A' as expected.
