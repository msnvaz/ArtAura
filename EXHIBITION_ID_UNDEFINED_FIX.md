# Exhibition ID Undefined Fix - Critical Bug Resolution

## 🚨 Critical Issue Fixed: Exhibition ID Undefined Error

### ❌ **Error Message:**
```
🔄 Updating exhibition undefined status to verified
PUT http://localhost:8081/api/exhibitions/undefined/status 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ Error: Failed to convert value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.lang.Integer'; 
For input string: "undefined"
```

### 🐛 **Problem:**
When clicking **Approve** or **Reject** buttons, the exhibition ID was `undefined`, causing the API call to fail with a 500 error.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis:

### **Backend Response Structure:**

**ExhibitionDAOImpl.java - getAllExhibitions() SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    id as exhibition_id,  -- ← Database ID aliased as exhibition_id
    created_by as artist_id, 
    title, 
    ...
FROM exhibitions
```

**ExhibitionDTO.java:**
```java
private Integer exhibitionId;  // ← Mapped to exhibitionId field

public Integer getExhibitionId() {
    return exhibitionId;
}
```

**JSON Response:**
```json
{
  "exhibitionId": 2,  // ← Serialized as camelCase
  "title": "Timeless Strokes",
  ...
}
```

### **Frontend Mapping (BEFORE FIX):**

**VerificationList.jsx - Line 64:**
```javascript
id: exhibition.id,  // ← Looking for 'id' but backend sends 'exhibitionId'
                     // Result: id = undefined ❌
```

**Button Click:**
```javascript
onClick={() => handleStatusChange(selectedExhibition.id, 'approved')}
//                                                    ↑
//                                              undefined ❌
```

**API Call:**
```javascript
PUT /api/exhibitions/undefined/status  // ← undefined in URL!
```

**Backend Error:**
```
Failed to convert 'undefined' to Integer
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented:

### **Updated Frontend Mapping:**

**VerificationList.jsx - Line 64:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (❌ Not working):
id: exhibition.id,

// AFTER (✅ Fixed):
id: exhibition.exhibitionId || exhibition.id,
```

**Fallback Mapping - Line 101:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (❌ Not working):
id: exhibition.id || index,

// AFTER (✅ Fixed):
id: exhibition.exhibitionId || exhibition.id || index,
```

### **Fallback Order:**
1. **First try:** `exhibition.exhibitionId` (correct field from backend)
2. **Fallback:** `exhibition.id` (if response uses different format)
3. **Last resort:** `index` (array index as ID if both fail)

## 📝 Files Modified:

### **Client Side:**
- **`client/src/pages/Moderator/VerificationList.jsx`**
