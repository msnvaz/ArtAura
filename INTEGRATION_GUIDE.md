# Artist Portfolio System - Integration Guide

## Routes Added to App.jsx

The following new routes have been integrated into the application:

### 1. Public Artist Portfolio
- **Route**: `/artist/:artistId`
- **Component**: `PublicArtistPortfolio`
- **Purpose**: Public-facing portfolio where visitors can view artist profiles and place orders
- **Example URL**: `http://localhost:3000/artist/123`

### 2. Order Management (Artist Dashboard)
- **Route**: `/artist/orders`
- **Component**: `OrderManagement`
- **Purpose**: Artists can view, manage, confirm/reject orders, and set collection times
- **Example URL**: `http://localhost:3000/artist/orders`

### 3. Existing Artist Portfolio (Private)
- **Route**: `/artist/portfolio`
- **Component**: `ArtistPortfolio`
- **Purpose**: Artist's private portfolio management (existing functionality)

## Testing the Integration

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure your backend API supports:
   - Fetching artist profile by ID
   - Artwork ordering endpoints
   - Custom artwork request endpoints
   - Order management endpoints

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Public Artist Portfolio
1. Navigate to `/artist/:artistId` (replace :artistId with actual artist ID)
2. Verify you can:
   - View artist profile (read-only)
   - Browse artworks
   - Click "Order Now" on available artworks
   - Open custom artwork request modal
   - Submit orders successfully

#### 2. Order Management (Artist View)
1. Navigate to `/artist/orders`
2. Verify you can:
   - View incoming orders
   - Filter orders by status
   - Confirm/reject orders
   - Set collection times for confirmed orders
   - View order details

#### 3. Integration Points
1. Test navigation between:
   - Artist dashboard → Order management
   - Public portfolio → Order submission
   - Artist portfolio → Public view

## Components Created

### Order-Related Components
- `ArtworkOrderModal.jsx` - Modal for ordering existing artworks
- `CustomArtworkOrderModal.jsx` - Modal for custom artwork requests
- `OrderManagement.jsx` - Artist order management interface

### Refactored Portfolio Components
- `ProfileHeader.jsx` - Modular artist profile header
- `NavigationTabs.jsx` - Portfolio navigation tabs
- `ArtworksGrid.jsx` - Artwork display grid

### Updated Components
- `ArtworkDetailModal.jsx` - Now supports both public and private views
- `App.jsx` - Added new routes

## API Integration Notes

Ensure your backend provides these endpoints:
```
GET /api/artists/:id - Get artist profile
GET /api/artists/:id/artworks - Get artist's artworks
POST /api/orders/artwork - Create artwork order
POST /api/orders/custom - Create custom artwork request
GET /api/artists/:id/orders - Get artist's orders
PUT /api/orders/:id/confirm - Confirm order
PUT /api/orders/:id/reject - Reject order
PUT /api/orders/:id/collection-time - Set collection time
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the new routes in your development environment
2. Verify order submission flows work end-to-end
3. Test artist order management functionality
4. Update navigation menus to include links to new routes
5. Add authentication guards as needed
6. Style components to match your design system

## Navigation Links to Add

Consider adding these navigation links:

### For Artists (in dashboard/nav)
```jsx
<Link to="/artist/orders">Manage Orders</Link>
<Link to="/artist/portfolio">My Portfolio</Link>
```

### For Public Users
```jsx
<Link to="/artist/123">View Artist Portfolio</Link>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are working
3. Ensure proper authentication tokens
4. Check that artist IDs exist in your database
5. Verify image upload functionality for custom requests
