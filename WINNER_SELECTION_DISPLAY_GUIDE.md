# Winner Selection - Display Guide

## Overview
The Winner Selection page now displays completed challenges with full details including:
- Challenge information (name, description, category, deadlines)
- Scoring criteria breakdown (Likes, Comments, Shares weights)
- Winners list (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Completed Challenges Dropdown**
- Only shows challenges with status: 'completed', 'complete', 'finished', or 'done' (case-insensitive)
- Sorted by completion date (most recent first)
- Displays completion date in the dropdown option text
- Guard prevents selecting non-completed challenges

### 2. **Challenge Details Display**
When a challenge is selected, the following sections are shown:

#### Challenge Information Card
- **Challenge Name** with "Completed" badge
- **Category** badge (if available)
- **Description**
- **Completion Date**
- **Deadline Date**
- **Max Participants**

#### Scoring Criteria Section
Displays the three main scoring weights:
- **Likes Weight** (%) - with Heart icon
- **Comments Weight** (%) - with MessageCircle icon
- **Share Weight** (%) - with Send icon
- **Total Weight** - sum of all weights (should be 100%)

Each criterion is shown in a card with:
- Icon representation
- Percentage value
- Clean typography and color coding

#### Winners Display Section
Shows the top 3 winners with:
- **Position badges** (1st ðŸ¥‡, 2nd ðŸ¥ˆ, 3rd ðŸ¥‰)

### 3. **Data Mapping & Fallbacks**
The component handles various field name formats from the API:
- `title` / `name` / `challengeName`
- `deadlineDateTime` / `deadline` / `completedDate`
- `scoringCriteria` / `scoring`
- `participants` / `participantCount`
- `submissions` / `submissionCount`

Default scoring criteria if not provided:
```javascript
{
  likesWeight: 34,
  commentsWeight: 33,
  shareWeight: 33
}
```

### 4. **Debug Logging**
Console debug messages help verify:
- Number of challenges fetched from API
- Number of completed challenges detected
- Selected challenge data structure
- Scoring criteria values
- Winners array

2. Or click **"Select Winners"** button in the header
3. Select a completed challenge from the dropdown
4. View:
