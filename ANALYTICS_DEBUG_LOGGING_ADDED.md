# Analytics Fix - Added Debug Logging

## What You Asked For

You wanted the analytics to calculate:
1. **Total Revenue** - SUM of `total` column from `shop_orders` where `shop_id` matches and `status = 'approved'`
2. **Total Orders** - COUNT of orders from `shop_orders` where `shop_id` matches and `status = 'approved'`  
3. **Customer Count** - COUNT of distinct `artist_id` from `shop_orders` (artists who ordered)

## What I Found

**The backend code ALREADY does exactly this!** âœ…

The SQL query in `AnalyticsDAOImpl.java` line 24-30:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(SUM(total), 0) as totalRevenue,       -- âœ… Sums total column
    COUNT(*) as totalOrders,                         -- âœ… Counts orders
    COUNT(DISTINCT artist_id) as totalCustomers,     -- âœ… Counts unique artists
    COALESCE(AVG(total), 0) as avgOrderValue 
FROM shop_orders                                     -- âœ… Your table name
WHERE shop_id = ? AND status = 'approved'           -- âœ… Filters correctly
```

## What I Changed

I added **debug logging** to see what data is actually being fetched from the database:

```java
System.out.println("===== ANALYTICS DEBUG =====");
System.out.println("SQL Query: " + sql);
System.out.println("Shop ID: " + shopId);
System.out.println("RESULTS FROM DATABASE:");
System.out.println("  Total Revenue: " + ...);
System.out.println("  Total Orders: " + ...);
System.out.println("  Total Customers: " + ...);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend server**
2. **Refresh the Analytics page** in your browser
3. **Check the backend console** - you'll see the debug output showing:
   - The exact SQL query being run
   - The shop_id being queried
   - The actual results from your database

## What You'll See

The console will show you exactly what's in your database. If it shows:
- Total Revenue: 0
- Total Orders: 0
- Total Customers: 0

Then there's **NO data in the shop_orders table for shop_id = 19 with status = 'approved'**.

If it shows actual numbers, then the data exists and the frontend might have a different issue.

**No more SQL files! The backend logic was already correct - we just needed visibility into what it's fetching.** ðŸŽ¯
