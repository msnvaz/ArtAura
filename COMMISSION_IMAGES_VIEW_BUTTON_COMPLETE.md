5. **Navigates images** → Uses arrows, thumbnails, or keyboard
6. **Zooms/Downloads** → Can zoom in/out or download any image
7. **Closes modal** → Clicks X button or presses ESC

## Troubleshooting

### Button Doesn't Appear:
**Issue:** "View Images" button not showing
**Causes:**
1. Commission has no reference images (expected)
2. `referenceImages` field is null/undefined in API response
3. Backend not fetching images from database

**Solution:** Check browser console for API response structure

### Images Don't Load:
**Issue:** Modal opens but images show placeholder
**Causes:**
1. Image files don't exist in `server/uploads/` folder
2. Wrong file paths in database
3. Vite dev server not serving /uploads folder

**Solution:** 
- Verify files exist in uploads folder
- Check image paths in database match actual files
- Ensure Vite serves static files from uploads

### Modal Doesn't Close:
**Issue:** Can't close modal
**Causes:**
1. ESC key handler not working
2. Click outside not implemented (by design)
3. Close button click handler issue

**Solution:**
- Try ESC key
- Click the X button in top right
- Refresh page if stuck
