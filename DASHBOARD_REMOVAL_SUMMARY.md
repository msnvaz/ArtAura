## ⚠️ Important: Update Login Redirect

You may need to update where shop owners are redirected after login:

**Check these files**:
- `client/src/components/auth/login.jsx`
- `client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`

**Change**:
```javascript
navigate("/shop/dashboard")  // OLD - will cause 404 error
```

**To**:
```javascript
navigate("/shop/orders")  // NEW - redirect to Orders page
// or
navigate("/shop/catalog")  // Alternative - redirect to Catalog page
```

✅ Verify no console errors
✅ Check that all remaining pages load correctly

## Status
