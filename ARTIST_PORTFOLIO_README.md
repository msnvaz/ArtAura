  isOpen={isOrderingArtwork}
  onClose={() => setIsOrderingArtwork(false)}
  artwork={selectedArtwork}
  artist={artistProfile}
/>

// For custom artwork requests  
<CustomArtworkOrderModal
  isOpen={isOrderingCustom}
  onClose={() => setIsOrderingCustom(false)}
  artist={artistProfile}
/>
```

## Data Flow
