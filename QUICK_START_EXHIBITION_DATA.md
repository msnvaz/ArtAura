# ‚úÖ Exhibition Data Integration - READY TO TEST!

## üéâ What Was Completed

I've successfully implemented the system to **fetch all 6 exhibitions from your database** and display them in the Moderator Dashboard Verification page!

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **403 Forbidden Error** - Added `/api/exhibitions/**` to SecurityConfig permitAll list
2. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Added detailed console logging to help debug issues
3. **Added Missing Fields** - Included `requirements` and `likes` in the UI
4. **Comprehensive UI** - Shows ALL database fields in cards and modal

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Ensure Backend is Running
Your Spring Boot application should already be running on **port 8081**.

**Check if it's running:**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
```

If you see output, the server is running! ‚úÖ

**If not running, start it:**
```cmd
cd c:\Users\anush\OneDrive\Desktop\ArtAura\server\artaura
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Wait for this message: `Started ArtauraApplication in X.XXX seconds`

### Step 2: Test the API Endpoint
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:8081/api/exhibitions' -Method Get
```

**Expected Result:** You should see JSON data for all 6 exhibitions!

### Step 3: Open Your Frontend
1. Make sure your frontend is running on `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to **Moderator Dashboard**
3. Click on the **Verification** tab

### Step 4: Verify the Data Display
You should see:
- **Total Exhibitions:** 6
- **Pending:** 1 (Urban Echoes)
- **Approved:** 4 (Timeless Strokes, Digital Dreams, Whispers of Nature, Brush & Beyond)
- **Rejected:** 1 (Faces & Feelings)

## ‚ú® Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm the data is displaying correctly:

1. **Test Status Updates** - Approve/reject exhibitions and verify changes persist
2. **Test Search** - Ensure searching by title, organizer, venue works
3. **Test Filters** - Verify filtering by status works correctly
4. **Check Responsiveness** - Test on different screen sizes
5. **Verify Database Updates** - Check that status changes reflect in the database

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Frontend still showing "Failed to load exhibitions"

**Solutions to try:**
1. **Hard refresh the browser:** Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache:** DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear Storage
3. **Restart frontend dev server:**
   ```cmd
   cd c:\Users\anush\OneDrive\Desktop\ArtAura\client
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Check backend logs** for any errors in the terminal running Spring Boot
5. **Verify .env file** has correct API URL: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8081`

**Problem:** Statistics showing 0/0/0/0

**Solution:** This means the API call failed. Check:
- Backend is running on port 8081
- No CORS errors in browser console
- JWT token is valid (log out and log back in)
