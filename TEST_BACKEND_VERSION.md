# Test if Backend Has New Analytics Code

## How to Check Backend Logs

1. **Go to Terminal: Run: ArtauraApplication**
2. **Look for this line when you access the analytics page:**
   ```
   INFO ... Fetching analytics for shop: 19 with period: 30days
   ```

3. **Then look for the ERROR message below it**
4. **Copy the FULL Java stack trace** and send it to me

## What the Error Will Tell Us

### If you see this error:
```
java.sql.SQLException: ... no data found
```
→ The NEW code is NOT running (old server still active)

### If you see this log but NO error:
```
INFO ... Fetching analytics for shop: 19 with period: 30days
INFO ... Analytics fetched successfully
```
→ The NEW code IS running! (Something else is wrong)

## Quick Fix - Force Restart Server

**STOP the current server:**
1. Go to "Terminal: Run: ArtauraApplication"
2. Press **Ctrl + C** 
3. Wait for it to fully stop

**START with fresh compiled code:**
```powershell
cd D:\Artaura\ArtAura\server\artaura
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**OR use VS Code Run button:**
- Click the ▶️ Run 'ArtauraApplication' button

## After Restart

1. Wait for: `Started ArtauraApplication in X seconds`
2. Refresh browser: **Ctrl + Shift + R**
3. Go to Analytics page
4. Check result!

**CRITICAL:** The server MUST be restarted with the newly compiled code for the error handling to work!
